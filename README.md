# React Daily Practice (Deprecated)

*created with CRA, no longer maintained*

This repository is dedicated to daily practice with **React**.  
The goal is to build small projects and exercises every day to improve problem-solving, coding discipline, and component-based thinking.
 
This project follows **CRUD principles** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and applies the **DRY** (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) coding methodology for cleaner and more maintainable code.
