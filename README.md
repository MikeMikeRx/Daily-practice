# React Daily Practice  

This repository is dedicated to **daily React practice** through small projects and exercises.  
The goal is to build discipline, strengthen problem-solving skills, and improve coding by repeating core concepts until they become second nature.  

## Structure  

- The `main` branch contains the overall practice setup and documentation.  
- Each **branch** contains a finished small project or exercise, focusing on:  
  - Building reusable components  
  - Handling and managing state  
  - Applying localStorage where useful  
  - Practicing styling and layout  

## Approach  

- Practice **every day** with a small React task or project.  
- Push progress and completed projects to separate branches.  
- Merge finished work into `main` to track activity and progress.  

## Goals  

- Build consistency through repetition.  
- Improve confidence by completing exercises at first try.  
- Strengthen fundamental React knowledge step by step.
