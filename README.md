# React Daily Practice 📝

This repository is for my **daily React practice**.  
Each branch contains a finished mini project or exercise focused on components, state management, and coding on my own.

## Structure
- `main` → Base setup and general notes  
- Other branches → Finished Daily tasks

## Goal 🎯
Practice React every day on a mini project until I can complete it on the first try. Then, upload finished projects to a separate branch. The goal is to build discipline and improve problem-solving through coding.
