# React Daily Practice

This repository is dedicated to daily practice with **React**.  
The goal is to build small projects and exercises every day to improve problem-solving, coding discipline, and component-based thinking.
 
This project follows **CRUD principles** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and applies the **DRY** (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) coding methodology for cleaner and more maintainable code.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
- Build discipline by coding daily (at least 1â€“2 hours).  
- Get to the point where projects can be built in **one attempt** without rewrites.  
- Improve problem-solving skills and deepen React fundamentals.
- Each mini-project is saved separately on branch when finished.
